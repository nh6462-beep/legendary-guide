    "This notebook documents the implementation of Use Case 1 (UC1) of the OOPS Banner App project. \n",
    "UC1 serves as the foundational step where we print the literal text \"OOPS\" to the console using Java fundamentals.\n",

    "The implementation covers:\n",
    "- Java class structure and the main method\n",

    "## 1. Create Feature Branch for UC1\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in professional Git workflow is to create an isolated feature branch for development work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Git Command\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git checkout -b feature/UC1-PrintOOPS\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Feature Branches?\n",
    "- Isolates UC1 development from the main codebase\n",
    "- Allows parallel development of multiple features\n",
    "- Enables code review via pull requests\n",
    "- Maintains a clean main/dev branch history\n",
    "\n",
    "### Branching Strategy\n",
    "- **Feature Branch**: `feature/UC1-PrintOOPS` - For UC1 feature development\n",
    "- **Dev Branch**: `dev` - Integration branch for all features\n",
    "- **Main Branch**: `main` - Production-ready code"

    "## 2. Understanding Class Structure and Main Method\n",
    "\n",
    "### Java Class as a Container\n",
    "A class in Java serves as a **container for data and logic**:\n",
    "- **Data**: Instance variables (attributes/fields)\n",
    "- **Logic**: Methods (functions/behaviors)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Main Method\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public static void main(String[] args)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Components:**\n",
    "- `public`: Accessible from anywhere (required for entry point)\n",
    "- `static`: Belongs to the class, not instances (only one copy in memory)\n",
    "- `void`: Returns nothing\n",
    "- `String[] args`: Command-line arguments array\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Main Method?\n",
    "The JVM looks for the `main` method as the **entry point** when you run:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "java OOPSBannerApp\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Static Keyword\n",
    "- `static` methods belong to the **class itself**, not to objects\n",
    "- Called without creating an instance: `OOPSBannerApp.main()`\n",
    "- Used for utility methods and the entry point"
