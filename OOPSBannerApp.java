/**
 * OOPS Banner Application - Use Case 1 (UC1)
 * 
 * This application demonstrates Java fundamentals by printing the literal text "OOPS" to the console.
 * It serves as the foundational step for the OOPS Banner App project.
 * 
 * Key Concepts:
 * - Class as a container for data and logic
 * - Main method as the application entry point
 * - Static keyword for class-level method
 * - String literals and method invocation
